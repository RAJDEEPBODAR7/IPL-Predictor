# IPL-Win-Predictor

IPL Predictor is a machine learning project built to predict the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. 
This project uses historical data from past IPL matches to train a machine learning model, which is then used to predict the winners of upcoming matches.

### Getting Started
To get started with IPL Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/RAJDEEPBODAR7/IPL-Predictor.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the project: python 'predictor.py'

IPL Predictor can be used to predict the outcomes of IPL matches. 
To do this, simply run the 'predictor.py' script and enter the required inputs when prompted. 
The script will then use the machine learning model to predict the winner of the match.

This ML Model Can Predict the Winning Probability of a team based on Past Records using Logistic Regression. 
The Output Probability Depends on Various Factors like Opposition team , Venue , wickets_fallen , balls_left ,etc. 
This Model is not Much Accurate , its Accuracy Rate is around 80% , Still gives Output Very Close to Actual Values.

### Dataset
The dataset used to train the machine learning model was obtained from Kaggle. 
This dataset contains information about all IPL matches played from 2008 to 2019, including the teams playing, the venue, the toss winner, the winner of the match, and more.

### Library Used
* PANDAS : for Data Cleaning and Analyzing The Datasets
* MATPLOTLIB : for Data Visualization
* NUMPY : for Handling The Data in DataFrame and Manipulating it
* SCIKIT-LEARN / SKLEARN : Machine Learning Library used for Building the Model and applying preprocessing to Data , Training and Testing The Data
* STREAMLIT : for creating simple Web-Based GUI
* PICKLE : For Pickling The Python Object Structure in Byte Stream
